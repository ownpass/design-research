# Design and Research repo
Hi! Welcome to the Design and Research repo for the OwnPass project.

## What do I find here?
It holds any user research (for example, usability testing, interviewing users), interaction design (for example prototypes, sketches for how Ownpass will work), graphic and visual design (for example logos, icons, typography design) and everything user related.

## Hea, where's the repo issues?!
We've turned-off Github issues for the moment. The reasoning behind it is so that all the design work stays in the repo for the mobile apps, browser extension, server app, etc. So for example, if there is some work being done for the Firefox extension, the discussion about that piece of design work should be in the [Firefox extension repo issues](https://github.com/ownpass/firefox-extension/issues). 

Make sense?

### I want issues!
If we find that we need an issues for this repo, just let us know, and we'll enable it. 

## I want to document stuff.
We have [the design and research repo wiki](https://github.com/ownpass/design-research/wiki). Write, write, like the wind my pretties!
